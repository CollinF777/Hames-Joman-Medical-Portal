Evveryone on Team Hames Joman do the following:
- Run this at least once (the No DB branch incase I change main)
- Download MySQL from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ if on windows just click the bottom one idk how to do it for linux gl Liam and Nathan
- We now have MySQL implemented into our project, so take the application.properties template and use it to match up your actual db info
- Run all the routes via postman and lmk if they all work correctly for you because if they don't then theres an issue with your db connection
