Evveryone on Team Hames Joman do the following:
- Run this at least once (the No DB branch incase I change main)
- Download mySQL from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ if on windows just click the bottom one idk how to do it for linux gl Liam and Nathan
- IF I get it to run with a db version we'll likely be running locally so just make sure your db is on port 3308 since that is what mine is on
